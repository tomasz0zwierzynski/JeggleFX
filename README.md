# PhysicsWorldFX

2D game api with physics engine for JavaFX and FXML in combination with SceneBuilder.

This framework uses JBox2D as a physics engine, and supports the bodies, fixtures and shapes functionality from JBox2D.
Includes demo games of Pong, Breakout, Asteroids and a 2D-platform game Jetpack.
This API was written as a prototype for a master thesis at NTNU.
